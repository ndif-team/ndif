class RequestStatusGauge(Metric):
    """
    This class abstracts the usage of metrics for tracking the status of requests across different services.
    Specifically, it handles the complexity introduced by Ray's distributed system when using Prometheus.

    Considerations:
    - Ray's distributed nature complicates direct use of Prometheus client objects, requiring dynamic HTTP servers or a Pushgateway, which adds complexity and potential performance issues.
    - To avoid this, Ray's built-in metrics API (Gauge) is used, which handles the distributed aspect automatically.
    - However, Ray's API differs slightly from the Prometheus client, leading to a messier interface in this class.
    - Additionally, Ray prepends "ray_" to metric names, which needs to be handled separately in Grafana.

    This class supports both Ray's Gauge API and Prometheus' Gauge API, switching between them based on the service type.
